# Linear-Regression
This python script performs linear regression in one independent variable to find the best fit for machine learning.

To run this script successfully, download the files, "LinearRegression.py" and "food_truck_data.txt" into one folder and run the script.

Following is the line of best fit after 5000 iterations overlaid on the scatterplot.
